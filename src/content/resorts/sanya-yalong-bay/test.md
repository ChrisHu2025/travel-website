Nestled on the southern tip of Hainan Island, Yalong Bay (Crescent Bay) is widely regarded as China's most beautiful beach destination. The 7-kilometer crescent-shaped bay is flanked by lush tropical forests and dotted with five-star resorts that have transformed this former fishing village into the 'Hawaii of the East.' What sets Yalong Bay apart is its exceptional clarity of waters - the bay is protected by a coral reef that creates calm, turquoise waters perfect for swimming and water sports.

Unlike other Chinese beach destinations, Yalong Bay maintains pristine white sand beaches with minimal crowding, especially during weekdays. The resort zone is carefully planned with strict height restrictions to preserve the natural landscape, resulting in a harmonious blend of luxury and nature that few destinations can match. The most prestigious resorts, including the Ritz-Carlton, St. Regis, and Marriott, each occupy their own secluded section of the bay, offering exclusive beach access and private amenities.
