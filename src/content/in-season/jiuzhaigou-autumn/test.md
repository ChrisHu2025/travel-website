Jiuzhaigou Valley transforms into a living canvas of colors during autumn. The name 'Jiuzhaigou' means 'Valley of Nine Villages,' referring to the nine Tibetan villages scattered throughout this UNESCO World Heritage site in northern Sichuan province. What makes Jiuzhaigou's autumn truly special is the perfect harmony between the colorful foliage and the valley's famous turquoise lakes.

The mineral-rich waters reflect the surrounding forests like giant mirrors, creating double the visual impact. Early morning is the magical time when mist rises from the lakes, softening the landscape and adding an ethereal quality to the already breathtaking scenery. The weather during autumn is also ideal for hiking - cool but not cold, with clear visibility and comfortable temperatures for exploring the valley's extensive trail system.
