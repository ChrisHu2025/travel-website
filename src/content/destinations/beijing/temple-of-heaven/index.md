The Forbidden City stands as one of humanity's greatest architectural achievements. Built in 1406-1420 during the Ming Dynasty, this massive palace complex served as the imperial home and ceremonial center for 24 emperors during the Ming and Qing dynasties.

Covering 720,000 square meters with 980 surviving buildings, the Forbidden City is the world's largest and best preserved ancient wooden architectural complex. Its name comes from the strict access control that existed during imperial times - only the emperor and his closest associates were permitted entry.
